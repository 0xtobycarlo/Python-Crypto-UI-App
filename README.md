Crypto Price Tracking Application Written In Python

This is the Python script for a basic application that tracks and showcases the price action of the top 100 cryptoassets in the industry, as per CoinMarketCap [https://www.coinmarketcap.com/].

You will be able to view the price action of the cryptoassets in 5 currencies - £GBP (Pound Sterling), $USD (US Dollar), €EUR (Euro), ₿BTC (Bitcoin), and ΞETH (Ethereum).

With this application, you are able to view the current price of a cryptocurrency in either of the 5 currencies listed, as well as the 1h % change, 24h % change, the 7d % change, 24h traded volume (represented in chosen currency), and the market capitalisation (diluted market cap will eventually be added).

The app will also show you a graph depicting the highest gainers and losers in a preferred timeframe, in case you wanted a more abstract representation of the top 100's price action. 

As well as selecting the currencies to view the statistics in, you are also able to toggle which of the top 100 assets are shown on the page. For example, you can toggle BTC on and off, depending on whether you want to isolate BTC's statistics, or not view it at all.
